This module contains various examples for the use of the XML
serialization format.

### Examples
- [SOAP](SOAP.md) - An example of a more complex structure with polymorphism and multiple namespaces
- [Dynamic tag names](DYNAMIC_TAG_NAMES.md) - An example of handling a custom serializer with delegate filtering 
  (and "almostXml" handling)
- [Example Jackson-like policy](JACKSON.md) - An example of using a policy to determine overall behaviour of the
  format in how it assigns names and how data is structured.
